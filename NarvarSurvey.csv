It was delivered on a Saturday, then they shipped it to UPS at a store.  I do NOT have the time to go to the store to pick them up. The box was sent back to Scholastic.  I called and asked if I can get those October book orders in 3 days because we have 1 week of vacation Nov 21-Nov 25 and will be back on Nov 28.  I don't know if the students will get their October books by Nov 18, this Friday or not. That is terrible.  We already received our November book orders too."

The box when it was delivered was all smooshed and one side was ripped open. One of the books I bought for my classroom was bent in half by the other books. The nice Harry Potter book 5 illustrated version that was meant to be a Christmas gift is also bent on the edges and the book cover is starting to rip in some areas. Very disappointed by the shape of the books that I received. Parents will likely order or buy books from other places that will ensure the books come in new condition, especially when expecting to use them as gifts."
