As a teacher it is embarrassing to ask the parent to pay that charge when that was never an issue before (that was your customer service persons idea).  Some parents don't feel comfortable ordering and placing payment online.  You lost an order due to that fee and recommendation and that was a parent that consistently ordered each month.,Shipping Fee,Shipping Fee,Email Post Call CSAT Survey,,4,3,Coryn Kutz,ckutz@clsd.k12.pa.us,2/1/2023

I do have feedback, though. I would very much appreciate having the paper flyers WELL in advance so I can send them home with our students, give them time to order and then wait the 10 days for delivery. For instance, the Valentine's flyers should be in my hands the beginning of January. This gives me, and my students, the time needed to announce the sale, view the flyers, place orders and get them back well before the holiday. Sending me the February flyers in February is not helpful at all. We end up not taking any orders in this case.

2/2/2023 23:57,459216875937,Teacher/Educator,1,"I have spent a great deal of time and energy attempting to resolve issues that I’ve encountered with Scholastic this school year. Initially, I was highly satisfied with the Scholastic team’s “resolutions”, however that quickly faded when I learned that they were complete empty promises. Alternatively, your representatives were just providing me lip service, despite email confirmation that the issues I had encountered were resolved. In reality, NO resolutions had in fact been made or attempted.   I have since discovered that there is no follow through with your representatives, even after receiving written confirmation. It is not the paying customer’s job to do the leg work to pester and repeatedly follow up with your company to ensure that action was actually taken and issues have truthfully been resolved as I was promised.   Issue 1: The Scholastic account associated with this very email address to which I am responding to, is an old account from years ago that should have been deactivated. After contacting customer service following a parent inquiry of their missing book order, I was informed that the mixup came about because they used my name in the search opposed to our class code. Fine. I have written confirmation that this account was deactivated AND permanently deleted (ie: no longer exist). I was also told that the account was deactivated and permanently deleted, and that going forward: I would no longer have any issues with orders being inaccurately placed. Not only was this “resolution” highly inaccurate, but no action was in fact taken. The account is still very active, nothing has been canceled or deleted, and I’m still receiving emails from the Scholastic account that is associated with this email address. My most recent customer service experience is another issue in it of itself, and I highly doubt that the proper action was taken. This issue remains unresolved.   Issue 2: The same issue of zero follow through occurred after I had inquired about missing birthday certificates from my order, This was despite receiving email confirmation again. It was only after I had inquired about it once more a while later when I realized that I still hadn’t received them.   Finding the time to repeatedly follow up and reexplain everything from start to finish should be unnecessary. This does not include the time I’ve had to take to explain to parents (who have made catalogue purchases) why their order was not received on my end and why there is a dramatic delay with their order, which ultimately will lead to further delay because the issue was not in fact resolved in the first place, and that we’re having to start back at square one.  Even more frustrating, I have spent a large chunk of my own money purchasing books for my students, and I had planned on regularly purchasing more, however given my latest negative experiences with your company and the personal frustrations due to empty promises and the amount of time wasted in trying to resolve issues— I have come to the conclusion that the best resolution is to take my business elsewhere. This includes telling my students and their families that we will no longer be participating in the Scholastic Book order. Although I am saddened by this resolution, it is what has to be done.   Whomever is responsible for reading this feedback, I do hope that my input is taken seriously, and that the necessary improvements are made. Despite my negative experience, I still wish your company the absolute best, and I truly hope that my terrible experiences were coincidental and isolated incidents.",Customer Service,CS Experience,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,Kristie Leo,kleo1015@yahoo.com,2/1/2023

When I contacted customer service I was told this was just for customers placing their first order in February. The flyer does not state a required order placing date. I was given 200 bonus points because the representative said it wasn’t possible for me to get the 10 books. It is unlike Scholastic to run tricky promotions.
