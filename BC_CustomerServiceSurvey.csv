I won't ever send cash again but that doesn't fix the problem for right now. I don't think I should be responsible for paying whatever is left of my balance.

I understand that the delivery person does not like to get into the car line in the morning and I understand. He or she needs to come after 7:45 perhaps when most cars have come and gone.

I was looking to get my students a book for their holiday gift, so the pack of winter themed books was a great deal.  16 books for  $20.  I have earned the bonus points and so I feel I should be able to use them on a deal like this.  Also, I don't feel like you should have to have a purchase of $75 to unlock the dollar books.  I did send order forms home with my students and I only had 1 student purchase books.  In the past I have had that happen and their total wasn't $25 so I actually had to pay the shipping.",Price,Price,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,Jenn Eckhart,jeckhart@clsd.k12.pa.us,11/9/2022
