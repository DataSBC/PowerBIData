I feel that my order could have been amended considering it was placed on a Saturday, so I would assume that the processing of the order did not start until Monday, today, the closest business day.

Customer service was great, however I have never encountered so many issues with an online order before. Perhaps there are some kinks that need to be figured out. At first everything was showing out of stock and then once I was able to complete my order my free book was out of stock and cancelled from my order without the option to select another free book.",Website,Performance/Navigation/General,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,4,,first name last name,mbailey@franklincityschools.com,44866

44868.54767,4.31229E+11,3,"Getting an answer quickly was wonderful. The only improvement is really a process consideration. Having to pay taxes and then refund following delivery is odd to me. I would think since I have a tax exemption on file, it could be removed prior to purchase. Also, if we must wait until the following, can it be automatic? Making the customer remember to come back and ask for the tax to be taken off, and reimbursed after the fact makes things more complicated on the customer-side. I greatly appreciate the communication and response time, no issues there. Just was hoping for a different answer or a simpler answer.",Account Balance/Payment,Tax,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,5,,first name last name,mindy.wilson@hillsdale-isd.org,44867
