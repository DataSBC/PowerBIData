The problem is that I ordered a large unit with drawers and it arrived with one drawer broken which I provided a photo of. The box was badly beaten up when it arrived. I was offered to send it back and get a new one but the box was too damaged to use for a return. And it seems excessive to send back a large heavy item when only a very small, light part is broken. I understand it may not be the normal procedure to open the box of an item and only send one part, but this is incredibly wasteful. This is a time where someone needs to think beyond just following the procedure which would be the normal for a book and do what makes the most sense.

I looked online and the item was in fact still available however it was listed for the regular price of $68.00. I contacted Scholastic to ask why if the item was available at full price why it was not available to me for the sale price. The representative responded to me and stated that there were limited sets for the sale price and when they were all sold they were not restocked. I responded and stated that if that was in fact the case Scholastic should remove the sale price from the website and that was a bad business practice to let people buy and item for a price listed and then tell them it was not available.

11/29/2022 7:38,455985040224,2,The issue was a duplicate shipment.  I felt that since it was not our fault more could have been done to resolve the issue.  The original order was placed on 3/15/22.  We received an invoice for the duplicate shipment on 11/10/22.  It was not resolved until 11/29/22 after many emails.  Most of the emails was on my part asking if it was resolved and if there was anything I could do.  The reps did respond quickly but not saying they would take care of the issue.,Balance Issue,Incorrect Balance,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,2,,first name last name,dpikowsk@psd202.org,11/21/2022
