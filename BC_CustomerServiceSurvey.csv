In every year since I've started teaching, Scholastic has allowed teachers to get students an affordable gift that was truly something special for kids. While $2 might not seem like much, given everything extra teachers buy for the classroom and with the current climate today, it just becomes unaffordable for most. Our school tries to encourage parent orders and for students to shop at the Book Fair, but the fact that most dollar books aren’t available until after a $75 order is out of our control. Again, I am extremely disappointed and hope Scholastic goes back to affordable options for teachers.

11/17/2022 18:39,455862990693,2,"I placed two orders. Within 5 minutes of placing the order, I received an email confirmation. When reviewing the confirmation I noticed I missed a digit in my mailing address on one of the orders. This was my fault. I immediately emailed customer service and told them what happened and asked if they could make the change in my order. They replied and stated they requested a change but cannot guarantee anything. They suggested I change my address in my account. There isn’t an address section in the account profile so this isn’t an option.",All Other,All Other,Email Post Email CSAT Survey,,,,first name last name,pries1sm@gmail.com,11/16/2022

I had problems using the card to pay for my bill online, but I called scholastic and spoke to Dave.  He fixed the problem and sent me a paid invoice.  I haven't given it another thought because it was paid and I had a receipt.  Last week I went into my account and to my surprise I saw that the invoice said overdue.  I immediately contacted scholastic and got a response from Karla,Case ID 8748364. I emailed her back  and included the paid invoice that I have received last spring.  I am assuming all is ok as I haven't heard anything back.  I have used scholastic books for 25 years of my teaching years.

11/17/2022 13:15,455863127375,2,A colleague and I both had a parent submit late orders. This is causing both of us to have to pay shipping (orders individually are not $25 minimum). I don’t understand why the orders can’t be transferred (put hers on mine) so we meet the $25 free shipping requirement. I don’t think you realize how much teachers already spend out of pocket.,Shipping Fee,Shipping Fee,Email Post Chat CSAT Survey,,,,BROOKE VALLANCE,vallancb@conwayschools.net,11/17/2022

I don't care how long he has been working there, he should have been more customer serviced oriented.  The customer is the one he should have been concerned with and not telling me he had only been working at Scholastic since September.  At the end of the chat he didn't even ask if there was anything else he could help me with or if i had any more questions.  He just hung up on me, ended the chat I was shocked.

I received no refund, no email, no apology, and when i contacted Scholastic I received no response, then after a phone call finally spoke with someone that said there was nothing Scholastic would do to remedy the issue.  This year I asked if there is a guarantee for delivery and again there is no guarantee.  I have been so disappointed with Scholastic I haven't used you at all this year and I'm not sure I will ever be able to trust this company again.  Teachers lost tons of money last year and instead of compensating or AT LEAST offering a discount or some incentive to use you again, we've received NOTHING.
