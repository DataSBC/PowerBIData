11/15/2022,4,"I would have to say that I appreciate Scholastic and its website except for 2 things.  First, I absolutely LOVE to get free books, but sometimes after I choose my $10 in free books, I decide I want to change my order or keep shopping.  Upon returning to the check out page, my $10 in free books have disappeared and I have to re-enter the data.   Secondly, after spending a huge amount of time choosing books for my classroom each month, I find it disappointing to get my box of books only to find that some replacement books have been sent instead.  Sometimes I would rather not have the replacement book(s) and would prefer my money and/or points added back to my account.  I have never really known what to do about it, so I just keep them, but am not exactly happy about it.  :(  Is there a general protocol about this?  I would love to hear back from someone.  :)  Thank you so very much!  :)",Damaged/Missing Item(s),Item(s) Missing

I am trying to buy books for my class for christmas and I am blown away that I cant find any dollar books and cant even use my bonus point to purchase anything worth while.  I can't even afford to buy my class some books!!!  Like I am going to spend $72 for a set of $3.00 books for my class!  No Way!  I can't afford that and I am truly upset!  I think you are taking advantage and I am to the point where I may not use you anymore!!!!,Price,Price

After spending about an hour on the phone and speaking with a variety of unhelpful people, I was finally able to get help via email.   I was told that it was up to me to tell parents to put the child's full name in the field.  Which we do.   We can not make them enter anything.  YOU, on the other hand, can.  You can make a field required on check out.  Or you could also give me the name of the person who paid for the books.  As the person  who is taking the order, it's your responsibility to either collect the correct information needed.  I was very disappointed in Scholastic with this last order.  Your customer ""service"" just kept telling me it was my responsibility to tell parents to enter the child's full name.  That's not helpful.  We tell parents this, and at this point it's too late.      It ended up  that a classroom aide",Customer Service,CS Experience

11/14/2022,1,Are there ANY tests performed from a parents perspective? Because the experience is beyond frustrating for someone who has worked in IT and web for 25yrs.  I cannot imagine what it's like for someone without experience in IT.  And the opening into a new tab action is incredibly frustrating.    Opening on a phone? Forget about it. What an absolutely atrocious experience on both android and iPhone.     Try adding money to your kids account. Account.scholastic would seem like a logical place... It's my account where I'd add my kids. But no. I have to add an ewallet for a FAIR for my kids. Why?  There is literally no connection between the fair and the account page. Why?    And book clubs? Don't understand how all this is linked together because it's currently an incongruous experience.,LOB Confusion,LOB Confusion

I had only one student hand me a check for a $5 joke book even though most parents pay online. I was going to be charged $6 shipping. I called and asked if that could be waived due to my red apple status. I have been ordering from scholastic every month for 27 years. I was told to make this child wait until next month to receive his joke book or to send the check home and make them pay online. If the parent wanted to pay online, she would not have written out the check. I ended up paying for the shipping myself so the child could receive the joke book. He was very happy when it arrived. I just feel that Scholastic should take small classes into consideration in cases like that since I called to explain.",Customer Service,CS Experience
