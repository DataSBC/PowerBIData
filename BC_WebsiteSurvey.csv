11/09/2022,4,I wish there were some single title 10 packs for teacher purchase as in the past.  The books have gotten so expensive and the 10 packs allowed me to give every child in my classroom a book on their birthdays and at holiday time.  I also miss the monthly listening library.  Your business is dependent on teachers promoting your books.  We get less and less for doing it.  I know multiple teachers who no longer send the book orders home.  They simply don't participate anymore.,Lacking Variety/Product,Single Titles vs Bundle Options

11/09/2022,4,I am very sad that I spent over $40 and didn't earn any free book selections. Your prices have gone up significantly over the years and the rewards for purchasing have dwindled to near nothing. I like to buy books from Scholastic to support my child's teacher but will be considering Amazon and other websites if Scholastic doesn't bring back some of the benefits of purchasing from them. I order every month and feel like each month I get less of a reward.,Bonus Points/Rewards/Promos,Bonus Points/Rewards/Promos

We just submitted our first order last month. I came on line to place a new order for paper catalogs. I couldn't easily find a way to do it but figured I log back in when I had more time. in the mean time, we received our book order and a HUGE box of more catalogs. WAY more than I need - especially since we are trying to steer our parents to the online order format. SO I came on today to say I had less students so I hopefully NEVER get so many paper ones to just throw away -- that kills me. I need to know how to manually choose how many and which types of catalogs to receive each month. Is that possible? Or will it always be this overdone auto order? We have students in K through 12 in my ""classroom"" so I can't just order one grade, but I don't ever need more than one packet of any spe",Customer Service,Kits

11/06/2022,5,"I was asked to review recent order. Fall Fun Reader Pack (8 books). I was happy with 7 out of 8 books. I did not want the witch book. I hated to throw it away, but I did not want to give it to anyone or read it to my class (Goes to witch school.). It was a waste of print cost. I did not want a public review, but I want you to personally take it out of the pack and put a generic fall book in its place. Let people purposefully pick that book if they want it. That is my review of the Fall Fun Pack.",Lacking Variety/Product,Lacking Variety/Specific Product Not Offered

Now you have 5 for $10, which is just too much for me to spend on my students when I am using my own money.  You call it an ""inflation buster,"" but it really isn't.  I find that parents aren't buying books right now, money is tight, especially for those attending the title 1 school where I teach.  I try to buy twice a year, once at Christmas and once in May, for end of year gifts.  If the books aren't affordable, I have to look elsewhere or not get books at all.  You guys used to have $1 books but now they are only available to those who spend at least $75.  It is just so disheartening because I used to love to buy from Scholastic.

Titles that have been available before are not available now, and it can be very frustrating to only have the ability to purchase specific titles during specific seasons/months or as part of a set.

11/03/2022,4,I couldn't stay on the chat line so I don't know what the last chast was from your end. But I have to books missing from a students purchase.

11/03/2022,5,"I can't believe how much money I saved, and am so disappointed I didn't start  ordering sooner!!    The only downside is not being able to have the books sent directly to my house.

11/03/2022,3,"I wish they had a family version where inside you could direct the books to children in the same family.  I don’t want to make two separate orders, but as the grandparent I would like to be able to direct my single order to two classrooms in the same school.  Possibly I just don’t see the link to do this.  As a child I was an avid reader and Scholastic was my source (with the library).  I still have a large box of Scholastic books I purchased in primary and middle school.  all Scholastic favourites.  I hope my suggestion is something that you can make happen.  Way easier for parents and that means more money for you.",Connecting Teacher/Class Code,Connecting Teacher/Class Code

11/03/2022,3,"Wish there was more selection. Challenging finding books for my grandson that would be engaging. There is more selection at the school book fairs. Was hoping there would be more selection options online than at the book fairs. Also, maybe allow the option for some adult books -- especially if trying to reach a dollar amount and can't find books at the child's level. I was hoping to add a book or 2 for myself to top the $25 threshold.",Website,LOB Confusion
11/03/2022,4,Teachers should be able to receive free shipping  when using their bonus points even if students do not order. Teachers spend enough of their own money on supplies and books for their classrooms. The least scholastic can do is give teachers free shipping.,Shipping/Delivery Concerns,Shipping Fee
