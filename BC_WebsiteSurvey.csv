By the end of the day, I went online & saw that the order had been cancelled a& was no longer available since I hadn't confirmed the order. But that was precisely what I had thought was done.

Now it's 6 for $ 7 less choices. I will be looking at other options for teachers to purchase books for all of their students.   Do better, Scholastic.",Price,Price

11/19/2022,4,We are a Christian school and our parents are concerned about traditional values.  I now have to send a letter about Scholastic stating that it is a secular company and to check book choices carefully.  I recently had to get rid of 2 of your books that contained pictures that are against my religion.  Please be very careful with diversity selections - especially for young children.,Lacking Variety/Out of Stock,Content Concerns

It would also be nice to have multiple wish lists. For instance, a class library wish list, or additional wish lists that are separate. For this example purpose, I wanted to be able to gift each student a book for Christmas, but in order to keep track  and make it easiest for myself - I deleted everything in my wish list to make a new wish list limited to their christmas book choices.

11/18/2022,3,"I am currently not happy/confused with the order checkout process. Yesterday, I had a subtotal of $73 dollars and was waiting until a student made an order today (which was my set order date 11-18-22) to move into the next bonus point category. When I logged in this morning to add the final order in, an online order had been pushed through, decreasing my overall total to only $28.  I am trying to understand why this order was pushed through without my submission. I am also trying to understand why those bonus points were not allotted since the total for this round of orders would have been more than the $75 to bring me into the next bonus point level. Please explain and/or fix this issue.",Possible TRF,Submit Parent Order- Tech Issue
