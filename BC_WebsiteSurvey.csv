Adding funds was even a multi-step process that required multiple logins to get funds into all three childrens' e-wallets.   If I didn't also have a toddler, I would've skipped the online and just taken my kids to the family day to shop.  However, I want them to have the ENJOYMENT of experiencing choosing their OWN books to hopefully build a better relationship with reading.   Also, it seems I can share their e-wallet link, but NOT a wishlist?  I have other relatives that would prefer to CHOOSE the book to buy for them as a gift.  Sharing the LIST should also be an option.   Even more difficult, the school wasn't in the dropdown unless typed and NONE of my kids' teachers were even on the list.  This makes me question the likel",LOB Confusion,E-Wallet

I ordered books that were through the book of the week and it put them in my parent cart instead of my teacher cart, despite asking if I was a teacher in order to get the deal.  It would not allow me to use the classroom funds, or balance from my teacher account to purchase the books which are NOT available through the regular search function.  I spoke with customer service and was told that it could not be moved to my teacher cart regardless of the fact that both my teacher account and parent account are tied to the same email and password.  I have shopped less than 10 times as a parent, but place several orders per month as an instructor.  The site should NOT default to a parent log in for me.  Perhaps consider making it optional which log in happens first.  This whole experience put a sour taste in my mouth.
